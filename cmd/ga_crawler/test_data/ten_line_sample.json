This was released in version 1.0 of the php-webdriver.\r\n\r\nAs no more development will be done in the previous non-namespaced branch (version 0.x), we need to upgrade to the 1.0+ version. This would require changing all usages of Webdriver classes and will definitely be an big breaking change, as all tests written for previous version would need to be updated (howerver this is kind of a search-and-replace)."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2016-01-01T23:00:00Z","org":{"id":429615,"login":"lmc-eu","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/lmc-eu","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429615?"}}
